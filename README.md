This is the code I used to help make the website for my NSEB chapter it's alot of HTML, CSS, and some Javascripts. These contains 6 diffrent html files, 5 diffrent css files, 1 javascript file, and 32 photos currentley. This project has took me about almost a week and I hope to finish pretty soon. I believe is good to have been only coding in HTML, CSS, Javascript for only one and a half or two weeks at the most.
