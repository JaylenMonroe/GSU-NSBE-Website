This is the code I used to create the website for my NSBE chapter. It includes a lot of HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. The project consists of 5 different HTML files, 2 CSS files, 1 JavaScript file, and currently 45 photos (photos not included here).

It has taken me about a week to reach a point where I'm happy with the result and think it looks pretty good. I believe it's a solid effort, considering I've only been coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for about one and a half to two weeks.

I plan to continue working on this project and improving it as I grow as a frontend developer and expand my skills beyond HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Iâ€™m excited to see how this site evolves in the coming months!
